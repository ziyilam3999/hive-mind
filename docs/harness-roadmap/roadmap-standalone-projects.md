# Standalone Reusable Projects

Ideas that emerged from hive-mind roadmap discussions but are not tied to the pipeline itself. Each can be a separate repo, Claude Code skill, or scheduled agent -- reusable across any project.

## How to Use This List

1. Each project is independent -- pick any and start
2. Skills go in `~/.claude/skills/` (global) or `.claude/skills/` (per-project)
3. Scheduled agents use Claude Code's `/schedule` command
4. When a project is started, create its own repo or directory and track progress there
5. If a project turns out to be relevant to the hive-mind pipeline, move it to `roadmap-backlog.md`
